## 🚀 Overview

`lcode` is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline your Leetcode experience directly from your terminal. Say goodbye to constantly switching between your browser and editor. With `lcode`, you can effortlessly fetch Leetcode problems, work on them in your preferred terminal-based editor, and submit your solutions, all without leaving the comfort of your command line.

This tool is crafted for developers who love staying in their terminal environment, enhancing productivity, and making the Leetcode grind more efficient and enjoyable.

## ✨ Features

-   **Fetch Problems**: Quickly retrieve problem descriptions and starter code directly to your local machine. (coming soon)
-   **Submit Solutions**: Submit your code and get instant feedback without opening a browser.
-   **Test Locally**: (Planned) Integrate with local test cases for rapid iteration.
-   **Language Agnostic**: Work with your preferred programming language.

## 💡 Recommendations for a Seamless Experience

`lcode` truly shines when integrated into a terminal-centric workflow. We highly recommend using it alongside:

-   **Neovim (or Vim)**: A highly configurable text editor that allows you to stay in the terminal for coding, testing, and debugging.
-   **Tmux (or other terminal multiplexers like Byobu, Zellij)**: Manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window, allowing you to have `lcode`, your editor, and a testing environment open simultaneously for maximum efficiency.

This setup creates a powerful and distraction-free environment for tackling Leetcode problems.
